### Hi there, I'm [Kieran](https://github.com/kieran-ryan).

I am passionate about Python, automation, staying up to date with the latest innovations in tech, and creating awesome products.

My software journey began in 2010 when I delved into programming with microcontrollers. However it was in 2013, when I started working with Python and in web development, that I knew I wanted to embark on a career in the space. I subsequently pursued a Computer Science degree at University, and I've been thoroughly enjoying my work as a Software Engineer ever since.

Aside from software, I enjoy writing history, immersing myself in literature, strumming guitar, listening to music, and engaging in a range of sports such as athletics, football, tennis, golf, and the traditional Irish sport of hurling.

I'm currently working on a few exciting projects:

- [pyprojectsort](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort) - a formatter for pyproject.toml files
