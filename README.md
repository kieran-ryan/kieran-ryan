### Hi there, I'm [Kieran](https://github.com/kieran-ryan).

I am passionate about Python, automation, staying up to date with the latest tech innovations, and creating awesome products.

My software journey began in 2010 when I delved into programming with microcontrollers. In 2013 I stumbled upon Python (version 3.3!) through [@CoderDojo](https://github.com/CoderDojo) and knew instantly that my calling was in software development. I subsequently pursued a Computer Science degree at University, and I've been thoroughly enjoying my work as a Software Engineer ever since.

Aside from software, I enjoy writing history books, immersing myself in literature, strumming guitar, listening to music, and engaging in a range of sports such as athletics, football, tennis, golf, and the traditional Irish sport of hurling.

I'm currently working on a few exciting projects:

- [pyprojectsort](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort) - a formatter for pyproject.toml files
- [pyprojectsort-vscode](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort-vscode) - a VSCode extension for pyprojectsort
- [removestar-pre-commit](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/removestar-pre-commit) - a pre-commit hook for removestar
- [python-package-template](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/python-package-template) - a template for building Python packages
- [cucumber-messages](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/cucumber-messages) - Python support for the cucumber messages protocol
- [leabhar-cliste](https://kieran-ryan.github.io/leabhar-cliste/) - a website for software practices, principles and concepts
- [Historic Kilkenny](https://historickilkenny.com) - a history website for County Kilkenny in Ireland
- [Historic Kells](http://www.historickells.com) - a history website and mill archive for the village of Kells in Kilkenny
- and contributing to open source [issues](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Akieran-ryan+-owner%3Akieran-ryan&type=issues&ref=advsearch) and [pull requests](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Akieran-ryan+-owner%3Akieran-ryan&type=pullrequests&ref=advsearch)

Thank you for taking the time to know me better.
