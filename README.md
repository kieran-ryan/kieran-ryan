### Hi there, I'm [Kieran](https://github.com/kieran-ryan).

I have a passion for Python, automation, staying up to date with the latest tech innovations; and creating awesome products.

My software journey began in 2010, when I delved into programming with microcontrollers for school technology projects. In 2013 I stumbled upon Python (version 3.3 for the win!) through [@CoderDojo](https://github.com/CoderDojo), and in an instant, I knew that my calling was in software development. I subsequently pursued a Computer Science degree in University, and ever since, I've been thoroughly enjoying my work as a Software Engineer.

Aside from software, I enjoy writing history books, immersing myself in literature, strumming the guitar, listening to music, and engaging in a range of sports such as athletics, football, tennis, golf, and the traditional Irish sport of hurling.

I'm currently working on a few exciting projects:

- [pyprojectsort](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort) - a formatter for pyproject.toml files
- [pyprojectsort-vscode](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/pyprojectsort-vscode) - a VSCode extension for pyprojectsort
- [removestar-pre-commit](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/removestar-pre-commit) - a pre-commit hook for removestar
- [python-package-template](https://github.com/kieran-ryan/python-package-template) - a template for building Python packages
- [Historic Kilkenny](https://historickilkenny.com) - a history website for County Kilkenny in Ireland
- ...and learning to solve the Rubik's cube... wish me luck!

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better.
